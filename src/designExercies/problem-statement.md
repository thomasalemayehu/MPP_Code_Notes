A Human Resource (HR) department keeps track of employees for
several companies, which it does by using an Admin module in a
software system. Each company has a name and is composed of
one or more departments. A department has a name and a
location. Each department has one or more job positions. A
position has a title and a short description. Either a position is
vacant or an employee is assigned to it . An employee has an id,
title, first name, last name, birthdate, hire date, salary, and social
security number . The HR department accesses the Admin module
periodically to prepare a report for one of its companies. To do this,
the company provides a list of all its employees. To prepare a
report, the Admin module extracts from each employee record just
the employee id, hire date, and salary, and then pieces together
other information to create the final report. [Hint: Think of the
HR dept as an actor.actor.]
